                    Hired as a contractor for multiple stints at Osborn-Barr, a leading advertising/public relations agency in St. Louis. Primary responsibility during both stints was working on a web-based workflow tool developed for Monsanto to manage their various PR campaigns. This system was developed using <em>object-oriented</em> <em>PHP5</em> with <em>PHP Zend</em>, an <em>MVC</em> framework.

                              Developed a <em>Web Services API</em> to be used on all future Osborn-Barr development projects. This <em>API</em> consolidates and streamlines a number of services and resources, such as <em>user authentication</em>, <em>geolocation via Google Maps</em>, and file uploads to <em>Amazon S3</em>. Its purpose was to simplify the implementation of <em>third party APIs</em> across all Osborn-Barr properties by creating an intermediary <em>web service</em> that could only be accessed with an encrypted access key and could handles all third party web service requests.
                         </li>

This framework allows for the rapid development of a clean, user friendly interface that performs consistently across all desktop and mobile browsers.

                    Responsible for all web application development for the websites associated with Bonneville International's radio properties in the St. Louis market at the time, including WVRV, WMVN, WIL-FM, WIL-AM, and WARH, the top-rated FM station in the St. Louis Market. Key projects included:

                         <li>
                              Migrating the sites to distinctive new templates that utilized the latest W3C standards to eliminate usability issues and improve SEO, while using DHTML and AJAX to retain the dynamic qualities of the original Flash templates.

                         <li>
                              Working with senior managers to construct a revised New Media Business Plan for Bonneville St. Louis.

                         <li>
                              Working with the sales staff to develop ideas that made sense for advertisers but also created compelling content for the websites, resulting in a significant increase in site traffic, as well as a 100% increase in generated ad revenue during 2006 and a similar increase in 2007. 
                         </li>
                         <li>
                              Developing an online "hook test" for WVRV, where listeners of the station were encouraged to visit the website, and rate hundreds of songs based on 5-second audio clips. The results of this survey were then analyzed and used to influence station programming. This application essentially replicated the same process used by outside consultants, but was performed at a significant savings. 
                         </li>
                         <li>
                              Filled in for Bonneville St. Louis' Director of New Media from January – March, 2007 while the permanent Director was on maternity leave. This experience led directly to being promoted to Director of Onine Operations for iChannel.FM later that year.
