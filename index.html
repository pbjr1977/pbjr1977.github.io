          Hi. I'm Phil. I kinda suck. And this is my website. It kinda sucks too. The end.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Ok, maybe I should go into a little more detail than that. I'm just not a fan of talking about myself.
          But we live in a society where narcissim is the only currency, and so I must.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm originally from the St. Louis, MO (or thereabouts), but I currently live in Rochester, NY. I've been
          a web/app developer/engineer/whatever (I'm not big on titles) since around 2005. I plan to get into that
          to some extent on this site. However, it's not going to be a portfolio site per se. I also want to share
          some of my interests outside of work.

            <h3>Mission Statement/Manifesto</h3>

            <p>
              I've been making websites and apps professionally since 2005, and un-professionally since sometime
              around 1995. Back then, it was a lot more fun and way more interesting. We were just making it all up
              as we went along. Now it's all about standardization and efficiency. Everyone uses the same bloated
              frameworks, which they don't really understand, to come up with generic solutions to problems that
              don't exist, and I'm just fucking bored and over it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              So I'm looking for something new. Maybe a boutique digital agency that's looking to do things the way
              they used to be done. Maybe a small business that wants a bullshit-free internet prescense. Or maybe
              (ideally?) something completely different. You might be surprised at what I'd be into. So if I sound
              like someone you want to work with, or just bounce ideas off of, I would love it if you slid into my
              DMs.
            </p>

                <h3>Positions Held</h3>
            
                <p>
                  I know resumes are meant to start with your most recent job and work backwards. But that never made
                  sense to me. Real life isn't like <i>Star Wars</i>. Stories should start at the beginning and progress
                  forward so you can see how they evolve. But you do you, if you want to skip to the end, I won't stop
                  you.

                        <li>
                          Co-developed a <strong>Content Management System (CMS)</strong>, along with accompanying documentation, to manage campaign worfklow, as well as create and manage emails to a database of over 10,000 participants.

                          <strong>Fun Fact About This Job:</strong> Advertising agencies are basically daycare centers for boozy, yet creative mercenaries and/or young professionals who enjoy being underpaid and overworked. Also, at no time is anyone really confident that they're going to have a job next month. Which is fitting, in a way. My 2 stints at Osborn-Barr were the bookends of a phase in my career where everything was always in flux as I bounced from contract to contract.

                      special for the release. They wanted to recreate that vintage album experience of reading

                    I started beekeeping in the Spring of 2020. Actually, that's not quite accurate. My girlfriend
                    decided I was going to start beekeeping in the Spring of 2020. We had watched a documentary on
                    declining bee populations and she decided to sign us up for some beekeeping classes and order a
                    couple of hives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fast forward to the day we got our bees...she got stung and decided beekeeping
                    wasn't for her. Apparently, she was imagining a beekeeper's life to be like a real life Honey
                    Nut Cheerios commercial, where bees greet her every morning by cheerfully pooping honey onto her
                    breakfast.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Spoiler Alert:</strong> That's not how it works.

                    Beekeeping is not easy. In fact, it's often frustrating. And you do get stung. But it's totally
                    worth it. Sure you can get honey from them once a hive is established (not a trivial feat btw),
                    but bees are incredibly interesting in their own rite.

                    Did you know that bees communicate with one another by dancing? Or that beehives operate pretty
                    much exactly like airports?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Or that any bee you come across is most likely going to be female?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Or that bee swarms aren't <em>necessarilly</em> as dangerous as you might think?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Or that bees are a vital part of the ecosystem and having them in your area has several benefits
                    to your community?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It's all true, and I'm going to try to write down some of the things I've seen and learned
                    about bees. In the meantime, here are some useful resources I found when I was getting started:

                  I <em>really</em> like to drink. Sorry, not sorry. However, as I've gotten older, drinking has
                  become more about the journey and less about the destination for me. What I mean to say is I'm
                  less concerned with getting fucked up as I am about enjoying what I drink. To that end, a few
                  years ago, I began keeping a journal of all the different whiskeys that I have tried. It's a long
                  list, and it's going to take me awhile to post them all, but I'm going to start publishing my
                  whiskey notes here.

                  Photography is another hobby that I've taken more of an interest in as I get older.
                  I had always been told that I take good vacation photos, and I finally decided to get more serious
                  about it around 2018 or 2019. I've taken a few classes and learned the basics, like the
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds" target="_blank">Rule of Thirds</a>
                  and the <a href="https://photographylife.com/what-is-exposure-triangle" target="_blank">Exposure Triangle</a>, and I've gotten a lot better. Here, I'm going to provide links to some themed
                  Google Photo Albums of some of my favorite photos I've taken.

                  I love travelling. At this point, I've been to every state east of the Mississippi, and most of
                  them to the west. I also lived in the UK for two years, and visited France and Italy, while I was
                  there. I've also traveled extensively in Canada. These are some of my favorite cities.

                <p>
                  Hand in hand with travel, I am also very interested in learning other languages. <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> is the most used app on my phone. I've used
                  it to learn several languages with varying degrees of success.

                    <strong>French:</strong> Je parle assez bien Fran&ccedil;ais.
                    <br><br>
                    I actually took four years of French in high school. I wish I had kept up with it, but I'm
                    doing my best to make up for lost time. I was actually pleasantly surprised with how much
                    French I retained from my teenage years. But, now that I practice it more regularly, I find
                    I'm increasingly comfortable speaking French every time I visit Quebec.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Italian:</strong> Io parlo un po d'Italiano.
                    <br><br>
                    I started dabbling in Italian during the Covid lockdowns. My girlfriend and I spent a lot of
                    time during the pandemic watching travel shows, cooking shows, and Italian
                    soccer...er...I mean <em>calcio</em>. So Italian came up a lot and it seemed natural to start
                    learning the language. My Italian isn't nearly as good as my French. But it's getting there.
